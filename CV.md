### Skills {#skills}

* Web Development
  : Specialising in Ruby, PHP, and Javascript I'm passionate about not just coding, but finding the elusive balance between doing something the right way using everyone's favourite acronyms (TDD, OOP, MVC, etc.) and getting it delivered on time and on budget.

* Project Direction
  : Experience in managing, directing and training teams, ensuring that team members are happy, engaged and productive, and implementing best practices such as Agile - or even better Extreme Programming (XP) - to get the job done effectively with as little time wasted on pointless managerial procedures.

* Business Development
  : I believe the key to web development is communication, and most importantly this is ensuring that the business goals and the technical needs are working together nicely. That's why I've found my most successful projects have been those in which I've been allowed to give technical insights into the direction of the business/product.
