### Skills {#skills}

* Software Engineering

  : I'm passionate about writing well-written, clean code that can be easily
understood and built on in the future. My expertise lies mainly in
object-oriented programming (although Ruby is my favourite language I'll happily
code in whatever language is required for the job), and wherever possible I like
to test-drive the process of writing that code.

* Project Direction
  : Experience in managing, directing and training teams, ensuring that team members are happy, engaged and productive, and implementing best practices as advised by the agile manifesto - Extreme Programming (XP) being my preferred flavour of agile - to get the job done effectively with as little time wasted on pointless managerial procedures.

* Product Development
  : I believe the key to web development is communication, and most importantly this is ensuring that the business goals and the technical needs are working together nicely. That's why I've found my most successful projects have been those in which I've been allowed to give technical insights into the direction of the business/product.
